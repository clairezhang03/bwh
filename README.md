# bwh: bruins with holdings

## Running App Locally
bwh is run through npm and Expo. 
To run the app locally, you will first need to install both:

```
npm install
npx expo install
```

For the best user experience, please also download Expo Go on your IOS/Android device.
Once you have everything downloaded, run the command:

```
npm start --tunnel
```
inside the bwh folder of your terminal.

This will generate a QR code for you to scan which will open bwh in the Expo Go app.
